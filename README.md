# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

Build a web application that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. Users can also filter the table data for specific values. Create the application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on the web pages. 

## Repo Contains

1. UFO-level-1 folder which contains:
* index.html
* static folder - contains 3 sub-folders
   * css - which contains the style sheet
   * images - image displayed on the webpage
   * js - folder that contains the app.js which has the JavaScript Code and data.js which has the table data

2. UFO-level-2 folder which contains:
* index.html
* static folder - contains 3 sub-folders
   * css - which contains the style sheet
   * images - image displayed on the webpage
   * js - folder that contains the app.js which has the JavaScript Code and data.js which has the table data

## Instructions

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
